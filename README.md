## Running Scripts

To run a breeding program, each breeding program directory contains a `00RUNME.R` script that can be executed from a personal computer, calling all other scripts in the order outlined in the manuscript.

To run different techniques, execute scripts independently.

#### Generating Figures

Each breeding program directory includes an `ANALYZERESULTS.R` script that generates simple plots of simulation outputs stored in .rds files. The 01_LineBreeding directory contains the `PaperPlot.R` script, which generates a plot for Figure 6 in the manuscript.
